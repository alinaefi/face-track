# Face Track App

## Overview

#### This is a basic web app sandbox project, nothing serious. We use face recognition technologies provided by the third-party service Tevian to detect and analyze faces. The app demonstrates how to integrate facial recognition into a web application, handling image processing, API requests, and database interactions.

## Purpose

#### This is an exploration project designed to understand and experiment with key concepts in integrating third-party services. It focuses on handling API interactions, processing data, and implementing face recognition within a web application.

## Functionality

#### The Face Track App provides a task-based system for handling image processing with face recognition. The API includes functionality for managing tasks, uploading images, and initiating processing.
- Task Management: Create, retrieve, and delete tasks.
- Image Upload: Attach images to tasks for processing.
- Face Recognition Processing: Submit tasks for analysis, updating their status as they are processed.
- Analytics: Retrieve basic tasks analytics data: gender, age, number of detected faces.
